# Algo: The Pseudo-Language Syntax Guide

This guide outlines the syntax rules and conventions for writing code in the pseudo-language **Algo**.

## 1. Comments

Comments in the algo are denoted by double forward slashes `//`. Anything following `//` on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter.

```
// This is a comment
```

## 2. Functions

Functions are declared using the `Start` keyword followed by the function name and parameters enclosed in parentheses. The function body is defined between `Start` and `End` keywords. **It's important to note that `End` is not just used to close a function, but also all loop and conditional statements.**

```
Start functionName(param1, param2, ...)
    // Function body
End
```

## 3. Variables

Variables can be declared using the `Const` or `Let` keyword followed by the variable name and its initial value.`Const` must be initialized before using it.

```
Const variableName = 10
Let anotherVariable = "Hello"
```

## 4. Control Flow

### 4.1. Conditionals

Conditional statements are defined using the `If`, `Else If`, and `Else` keywords.

```
If condition
    // Code block executed if condition is true
 Else If anotherCondition
    // Code block executed if anotherCondition is true
Else
    // Code block executed if no previous conditions are true
End Else
```

### 4.2. Loops

Loops can be implemented using the `While` and `For` keywords.

```
While condition
    // Code block executed while condition is true
End While

For variable in range
    // Code block executed for each value in the range
End For
```

### 4.3. Switch Case

Switch case statements are defined using the `Switch to`, `When`, and `Usually` keywords.

```compileToJs
Switch to variable
    When condition:
        // Code block executed when condition is met
    Usually expression
End Switch
```

## 5. Printing

Output can be printed to the console using the `Print` statement. You also add marker by placing them after a `,` like this `Print (a ,"variables")`

```
Print ('Hello, world!');
```

## 6. Indentation

While indentation is recommended for readability, it is not mandatory in the algo. However, consistent indentation is encouraged to enhance code clarity.

## 7. Example

### Odd-Even Check

```
Start oddEven(num)
    If num % 2 == 0
        Print (num, ' is even')
    Else
        Print (num, ' is odd')
    End If
End
oddEven(8)
```
