# Algo

Algo is a compiler designed to translate pseudo code written in a custom language to JavaScript. Currently, it's in its budding stage and supports limited conversion to JavaScript.

## Features

- Converts pseudo code written in `.alg` files to JavaScript.
- Simple and easy-to-understand syntax for writing pseudo code.
- Intuitive and minimalistic interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with Algo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algo-compiler.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start using Algo to convert your pseudo code to JavaScript!

## Usage

1. Write your pseudo code in a `.alg` file.
2. Run the Algo compiler with the following command:

   ```bash
   algo your_file.alg
   ```

3. The compiled JavaScript code will be generated in the same directory with the same filename but with a `.js` extension.

## Example

**Pseudo Code (example.alg):**

```
Start greet(name)
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
End 
```

**Compiled JavaScript (example.js):**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```
